Learning Journal 

Two days of starting to get in the flow of day class. Between the commute times and lecture/lab schedule, understanding what time I have available to manage is clearly important. The first day I never got into the SMACSS  portion of lab. (I antipate catching up this weekend) I enjoyed the first codewars and it went quickly. Cody my partner was very easy going.  A good thing but it was a little more difficult the next day. I have a strong personality and I struggle to present myself at a level that allows persons who may be more soft spoken to feel like they can take charge too. I checked in with Cody often but I still believe I need to develop better skills to ensure we tap all the potential the partnership could offer.   Getting used to the labs and pair programming (and my computer), the 2nd day went slow and we did not complete the lab during class time. At the end of the day though we conferred on the tasks left and divided them logically to be completed before the next day began (It would be difficult for either of us to meet outside school hours). Getting used to due dates and submissions as well. Add commit pushes could increase in frequency and a better plan for turning in the readings.  Overall a positive experience but the shortcomings definitely have impacted my grade so far. The goal is to address these gaps this weekend before the next week begins.
